🎨 Visual & Design Guidelines
•	General Style: Pixel art, clean, retro look.
•	Color Palette (simplified):
o	Background: we are working on it 
o	Platforms: clouds, turning transparent when touched. The symbol of the item inside should be falling down when cloud is touched.
o	Enemy: boss shooting tennis balls at Deniss every 3 seconds (he is on the top right corner of the screen), sitting on cloud.

•	Sound Effects:
o	Jump: short, bright "hop"
o	Tennis ball shoot: "pop" sound

🗨️ 🎬 Pre-Level Dialogue (Before the cloud level starts)
Denis (you):
"Welcome to the cloud, Johann. This is where I store all my skills — and no, you can’t download them."
Johann:
"Ha! We’ll see about that. Just don’t get lost up here — not everyone’s cut out for high-level performance."

🏁 🎬 Post-Level Dialogue (After you jump on the last cloud)
Johann:
"Okay… I’ll admit it. That was impressive.”
Denis:
"Told you. I don’t just bring skills — I bring altitude."
