🗨️ Dialog & Speech (Text & optional voice)
•	Game Start:
Denis: “Alright, Level 3. Time to get a bit personal. I’ve always been curious about how tech shapes the world—and how finance can steer that change. IDDP feels like the place where I can actually explore both and grow through each of them. Let’s go!”
•	Game End:  once Denis opens the bridge
Denis: "Level complete... but this isn’t the end, is it?"
Johann (smiling): "No, Denis. This is where the real journey begins."
Denis: "I have learned a ton and explored different passions — and somewhere along the way, I found out that this program is definitely my path.
 Johann: "Well…you've shown more than skill, you’ve shown real purpose. And that drive for innovation in banking? That’s exactly what we’re looking for."
 Denis: "Then… am I in?"

[After this final rhetorical question it would be nice to have a close up on Denis face]
