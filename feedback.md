Feedback Level 1

1. Delete the kebabs out of the game
2. Delete the old brown plattforms
3. Create boxes super mario bros style to put in the hobby items in, if you hit them from underneath with the head or you are standing infront of them you can open them up with “space” key (for reference review super mario bros gameplay on youtube, just the first level to understand the framework. I would like to keep it like that

The Item boxes should look like the golden question mark boxes and the items should appear from inside to up on the brick . There can be also platforms containing normal bricks with no items, a bit random but feasible to do. For reference on level creation watch super mario bros style first level gameplay. I want to create the levels similar to the original from the structure. Of course shorter but in general similar

4. Endboss fight should be included in the level, no separate background and screen. I love the idea of giving the screen a shake creating the endboss level. But it should be fluently included in the level.
5. Creating the right physics and animation of the tennis ball whenever you hit the space key.
6. Improving the playability of the endboss fight, concerning aswell the graphics, the shooting of the tennis ball ( It should fly endlessly like a sinus curve until it hits something (for reference review fireflower in super mario bros where he throws fireballs)
7. Creating a Game over Screen. Completely black screen with the sentence Thick and in Red (potentially if possible a dead animation of the character ) : Killing applicants is against HR rules. Please be mindful!
8. Creating a checkpoint after collecting the tennis racket
9. Player can shoot tennisball immediately after he collects the tennis racket
